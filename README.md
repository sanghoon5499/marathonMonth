# marathonMonth

** Project put on hold due to school **  

Get healthy by walking a marathon a month!  
MarathonMonth keeps track of your walking distance per day, and logs them into monthly and yearly data.  
The app is still in the prototype phase, with no real work done for the aesthetics just yet.  

Here are some screenshots.  
*Note: App is for use on a phone, but desktop use works as well.*
